J multi form factor adapter is a library and SDK for building HTML5 based views. The library is primarily a means of abstraction from using specific existing techniques - so as to future proof applications and code for the future. 

Another goal of j is to build a set of (standard pattern) recipes to be deployed by programmers when writing production code.
