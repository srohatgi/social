Folder Share
============
Out of the numerous folder sharing applications existing on the internet today, this app will attempt to be different. Following are the high level goals:

- each uploaded folder is **public** by default
  - updates from 3rd parties go through community governance process
  - community governance is performed by users who have changed/ viewed folder information before
- each folder is rendered as a web page
  - each folder can be thought of as a website
- each file in the folder has its own web page
  - there can be annotations on each web page
