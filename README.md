SOCIAL
======
Testbed for a new technology framework (Tau) for building lightwieght social applications. The set of specs which define the framework itself are present in `specs/` folder.

The framework itself is a work in progress. 

We refine the framework by building out a [reference application](http://lifetechno.blogspot.com/2011/10/social-software-part-ii.html).
