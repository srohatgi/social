SOCIAL
======
Technology framework for building lightwieght social applications. The set of specs which define the framework are present in `specs/` folder.

The framework is a work in progress. One of the first steps is to construct a folder sharing app. However, instead of being the general sharing limited sense, the app will by default **any** other user to add/ edit content. 

Also, folders are classified **automatically** by the app; and users of the app browse interesting content and produce thier variations on it.
